<h1>Calm Seas</h1>

<p>“Well, that’s it,” said the first mate. Her name was Eleanora, but everyone called her Rage, mostly because of how she reacted when people called her by her given name. “The <em>Mustard Flower</em> is completely becalmed —&nbsp;no winds and no currents.”</p>

<p>“Noted,” said captain Buckler. “What’s our food and water situation?”</p>

<p>“Adequate for several weeks,” said Rage. “Should I have the crew start carving oars out of the mast?”</p>

<p>The captain smiled. “Do you think it will be that long?”</p>

<p>Rage pointed off the port bow, where another ship, bigger than theirs, was sitting. “How long do you think those poor sots’ve been sitting there?”</p>

<p>“Still no response from our hails, I take it,” said the captain.</p>

<p>Rage shook her head. “No, cap’n,” she said.</p>

<p>Captain Buckler looked out at the other becalmed ship, deep in thought. “Prepare the long boat,” he said.</p>

<p>“I’ll take a boarding party,” said Rage.</p>

<p>Captain Buckler said, “I shall take a boarding party. I’m leaving ye in charge.”</p>

<p>“Captain–”</p>

<p>“Rage, I’m leaving ye in charge. I’m perfectly capable of taking a boarding party to that ship and getting a good look for myself. If a wind comes up, we’ll come back. Ye’ll probably just sit here being bored.”</p>

<p>Rage frowned. “Or, just maybe, I could have the crew empty the bilge so we’re ready to go. If it be in accordance with thy will, O Captain.”</p>

<p>Buckler swung at her, and she leaned out of the way. “Get on with ye, ye pompous bilge-sucking ass.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see the long boat prepared, cap’n,” said Rage. The captain ignored her, and went to his cabin to get equipped.</p>

<p>The crew put their backs to the oars, and the long boat only took a few minutes to reach the other ship.</p>

<p>“The <em>Golden Mocha</em>,” read one of the men.</p>

<p>“Look at the university graduate reading,” said another.</p>

<p>“I’m surprised ye know what a university graduate is, Monkey Barnes,” said the captain. “Now tie us up and get us aboard.”</p>

<p>“Aye, cap’n,” said Barnes. He hurled a grapnel up and over the rail, pulled it tight, then quickly scampered to the deck, just like his namesake. A quick tie off, and the rope was sturdy. “All set, cap’n,” he said.</p>

<p>Captain Buckler took his turn first, never having been one to let others go first. He ran up the ladder to the fo’c’s’le, but saw nothing out of the ordinary. He ran back down as the last of the crew climbed aboard.</p>

<p>“Teams of two,” he said. “Check out the entire ship. Grab what you want, but be fair, especially to our crew mates back on yon ship. Barnes, with me. Food and drinkable water first, spirituous beverages if you find any, then treasure. Savvy?”</p>

<p>“Aye, cap’n!” “Aye, sir!” “Aye!”</p>

<p>The crew set off, and Buckler said, “You think we’ll find food, Monkey?”</p>

<p>“Why would they abandon a ship with plenty of grub, cap’n?” said Barnes. “No land in sight neither.”</p>

<p>There was a sudden scream from belowdecks. Captain Buckler and sailor Barnes made eye contact, then sprinted off to the ladder. The hold was dark, but they could see the men at the end of the passage, fighting something.</p>

<p>“What’s going on?” Buckler demanded. As he got closer, he drew his sword, then let his arm fall to his side when he saw what his men were fighting.</p>

<p>It was a zombie! Tattered clothing dripped seawater while it hung from its decaying frame. It left wet footprints behind. With a moan, it moved closer to the sailors.</p>

<p>“Stay back!” ordered the captain. “Get behind me!” His crew squeezed past him. He raised his sword, and pointed it squarely at the zombie’s face.</p>

<p>“Stay back, or die a second death,” said Captain Buckler. He didn’t expect it to listen. He had killed zombies before, and knew how to do it efficiently, which was why he’d moved to the front. One zombie was not a significant risk. “Stay back!” he said again.</p>

<p>To his great surprised, the zombie froze in place. Buckler waved his sword, and the zombie actually shuffled backwards half a step.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think they did that,” muttered Barnes. He had his hand on his sword hilt, but hadn’t drawn it.</p>

<p>“They don’t,” said Buckler. He addressed the zombie. “What are you?”</p>

<p>The zombie moaned something that almost sounded like speech. It made the same sound again.</p>

<p>“What are you saying?” asked the captain. “Did that seem like words to any of you?”</p>

<p>One of the men said, “I’d almost swear it’s how they talk down south around the slave coast.”</p>

<p>The zombie moaned the sound again. The sailor said, “Maybe, could be.”</p>

<p>“What does it mean?” demanded Barnes.</p>

<p>The sailor shrugged. “If it’s the word, it means asking for help.”</p>

<p>“Hellllllllllllllll…p,” the zombie moaned this time.</p>

<p>Barnes said, “Gods below, since when can they talk?”</p>

<p>“Hellllllllllllllll…p,” the zombie repeated.</p>

<p>“What kind of help do you want?” asked captain Buckler. The zombie just moaned, and slapped its head with a hand, once, twice, then a third time.</p>

<p>“Cap’n,” said one of the crew, “I think it wants you to kill it.” The zombie moaned, and slapped itself in the head once more.</p>

<p>“Is that what you want?” asked the captain.</p>

<p>“Hellllllllllllllllp.”</p>

<p>The captain touched the point of his sword to the zombie’s forehead. “This?” he asked.</p>

<p>He would later swear, despite everything everybody knew about zombies, that the hapless creature met his eyes. “Hellllllllllllllllp.”</p>

<p>Buckler thrust his sword forward with all this might, piercing the zombie’s skull. Its arms and legs thrashed. It pulled off the sword and fell, backwards, on to the floor of the hold. It stopped moving.</p>

<p>Everyone was quiet for a moment, until the captain asked, “are there any places we haven’t explored?”</p>

<p>“No.” “No, sir.” “No, cap’n.”</p>

<p>“Captain’s quarters?” Buckler asked.</p>

<p>“We, me and Cedar, we looked there before we came down here,” said one of them, named Cutter.</p>

<p>Barnes had knelt next to the zombie, and was poking it with his knife. “It’s dead,” he said, “I mean, dead for good.” He looked up. “I never heard nothing ‘bout one talking, not ever.”</p>

<p>“Let’s get back to the <em>Mustard Flower</em> now,” said Buckler. “Don’t bring anything. If we’re still here on the morrow, we’ll come back, but I’m worried about my ship.”</p>

<p>They left the zombie lying where it was, and quickly ascended to the main deck. Cutter had his own spyglass, and he looked through it. “Something’s going on,” he announced. “I can’t tell what, but there’s a lot of running around.”</p>

<p>“Get in the boat,” said the captain, as Cutter grabbed the rope and quickly slid down. The captain was the last one off. He brought the rope and dropped to the small craft. The men grabbed him so he wouldn’t overturn the long boat.</p>

<p>“Put your backs into it,” he said, as the men started rowing. </p>

<p>“You think zombies?” said Barnes, in between strokes.</p>

<p>Buckler said, “I’d bet they don’t want us to kill them this time.”</p>

<p>The long boat drew near the <em>Mustard Flower</em> to the sound of screaming. Captain Buckler ordered the boat crew on board to fight. He was the first one off the long boat.</p>

<p>Zombies were everywhere he looked, and his crew was fighting them as best they could. They were outnumbered. He hoped the sailors he didn’t see were belowdecks and not dead in the ocean.</p>

<p>Rage called to Buckler from the fo’c’s’le, where she was fighting two zombies at once with a pair of escrima sticks. Her scabbard was empty.</p>

<p>“Cap’n!” she yelled, “they came over the side, just after you reached the other ship!”</p>

<p>“What about the crew?” Buckler yelled back. He stabbed a zombie through the brain, and ducked under another zombie’s attempt to grab him, trying to move closer to his first mate.</p>

<p>“All alive, so far, I think,” she yelled. “With your boarding party back, maybe we can turn the tide in our favor.”</p>

<p>Buckler saw a sword on the deck, and with a forward roll, he grabbed it. “I’ll bring you a sword,” he yelled back. He was almost to the ladder.</p>

<p>When he got to the top, he slid the sword along the deck. Rage put her foot on it, and kept fighting with the sticks. He came up behind one of the zombies and dispatched it, then stabbed another one, giving her time to pick up the sword.</p>

<p>“Came over the side?” Buckler repeated.</p>

<p>“I think so,” she said. “I was down below — one of the crew heard what sounded like scratching beneath the hull, and called me down. It was probably them.”</p>

<p>“At least they didn’t scratch a hole in the hull,” said Buckler. The ship suddenly bucked. Rage took out the last zombie and, without exchanging a single word, they ran to the ladder and slid down below.</p>

<p>Sea water was already filling the bottom of the boat. A zombie shuffled towards them, while another was climbing up through a hole, as seawater rushed in. </p>

<p>“YAAAAAAA!” yelled Rage. She cut into the nearest enemy’s head, cutting through the neck on her backswing. </p>

<p>Buckler splashed past her and attacked the zombie swimming aboard, cutting its head in half. </p>

<p>“I think there’s more underneath,” Buckler said. “Help me with some of the cargo!”</p>

<p>Rage grabbed a sack wrapped in sailcloth, and pulled it toward the hood. Captain Buckler grabbed hold. Together they pulled it over the hole, after Rage pushed the zombie down with her booted foot. </p>

<p>The captain held it down while Rage tipped a box on top. They moved more cargo on top of the hole, cramming as much in the narrow space as possible. </p>

<p>“Go,” said Rage. “I’ll keep watch here. Go see how the crew is handling it.”</p>

<p>“Right,” said Buckler, and ran for the ladder. He reached the deck just in time to see “Monkey” Barnes throw a zombie overboard.</p>

<p>“Barnes, report!” Buckler ordered.</p>

<p>Barnes spun and almost saluted. “That was the last of them, cap’n,” he said, “but there’s more in the water. Walking John thinks he sees a city down on the bottom of the sea, but you know him.”</p>

<p>“It would explain our predicament,” said the captain. “You injured?”</p>

<p>“Not me, sir,” said Barnes.</p>

<p>“Is anyone else uninjured?” the captain called out. Two of them raised their hands. “Get down belowdecks and relieve the first mate. The rest of you, patrol the deck and push any zombies back overboard if they try to board my ship.”</p>

<p>When his first mate appeared, the captain said, “Any changes?”</p>

<p>“They’re trying to push their way in, but we can keep them out,” Rage said, shading her eyes from the sun.</p>

<p>“I want your opinion,” he said. He pointed to the other ship. “The <em>Golden Mocha</em> didn’t have excessive water on the bottom,” he said, “so the zombies didn’t dig their way in. Unless I’m going crazy, it’s still drifting away from us.”</p>

<p>Rage looked over at the ship. “Sails look in good shape. They look like they’re catching a little bit of wind.”</p>

<p>“Which might mean they’re on the edge of whatever this is,” said Buckler. “I’m told Walking John thinks he sees a city on the bottom of the ocean.”</p>

<p>“Walking John?” she said, a bit scornfully.</p>

<p>“Yeah, I know, I know,” said the captain, “but he does have the best eyes on the crew. I don’t know what I’m seeing, but there’s a different color down there, and we drifted into it when we lost the wind. The <em>Mocha</em> is over near the edge.”</p>

<p>“What’s the plan, cap’n?” said Rage.</p>

<p>“Two groups in the long boat,” said Buckler. “That’s overfull, but faster than a zombie can swim, I hope. The second group are our strongest oar-men, and we drag that ship out of the doldrums. They must be near the edge of the sails are catching the breeze.”</p>

<p>“Okay,” Rage said. She hesitated, then said, “it will be hard for a half-crew to effectively keep them at bay.”</p>

<p>“Less than half,” the captain said, “since someone will have to row back.” Before she could speak, he said, “not you. I need you in command.”</p>

<p>“No zombies over there?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Oh,” he said, “I didn’t tell you yet. We found one. It begged to be killed.”</p>

<p>“What?” Rage said.</p>

<p>Buckler nodded. “That’s another reason I think it’s safe. It’s got to be near the edge of all this. Now, pick your crew and go. Just row as fast as you can.”</p>

<p>Rage said, “got it. Just hold on.” Raising her voice, she shouted toward the main cabin, “All you salts, you can bandage your wounds later. Get on the long boat, and put your backs to it!”</p>

<p>“That’s too many of us,” said one.</p>

<p>“I SAID NOW!” screamed Rage. Buckler nodded his head for good measure, but the crew were already moving.</p>

<p>Rage said, “be safe, cap’n,” and followed the sailors into the long boat.</p>

<p>Buckler went belowdecks to retrieve his watchers. Nothing had gotten in, but the cargo over the hole was being dug into from beneath. He pulled the men up on deck with him. He sent everyone on a quick patrol of the rail, then called them together to wait for the long boat. It quickly arrived, and they climbed in and took the oars.</p>

<p>When they reached the <em>Golden Mocha</em> Rage was ready with a stiff halyard, which she tossed into the long boat. It was already tied to the gunwale, near the prow.</p>

<p>“Put your backs to it!” the captain cried, and the men all hauled their oars in time. The rope went taught, and for a minute it seemed they were making no progress. Then, the captain saw smaller waves moving away from the ship as it was pulled forward. He steered the longboat toward where he hoped the edge of the becalming effect was. Soon he was proven right — the rope loosened as the sails filled with the wind.</p>

<p>“Captain!” called Rage, “the ship is underway! Get back onboard!”</p>

<p>They let the longboat drift to the side, climbed aboard, then pulled the boat on board after them with the pulleys.</p>

<p>“Still not zombies on board?” asked the captain.</p>

<p>Rage said, “we did a quick check. Nothing seems out of the ordinary. Let’s get away, I say, and then check again. As least we can run away now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, do that,” Captain Buckler said, absentmindedly. He was looking back at the <em>Mustard Flower</em>, as it faded into the distance. “I had that ship well-nigh unto ten years,” he said. </p>

<p>Rage put a hand on his shoulder. “How many ships do you think that place took? I’ve never heard of anything like it.”</p>

<p>“I’ve never heard of it, either, so I’d say they took every ship. We got lucky.”</p>

<p>Rage smiled. “We’ll report it, and they’re supply of ships will dry up. Hell, maybe they’ll give us a reward! The crew wouldn’t mind a night on the town.”</p>

<p>“You can always see the bright side,” the captain said. He stared back until his ship was too small to see.</p>

<p>The End</p>
