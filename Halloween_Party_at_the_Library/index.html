<h1>Hallowe&#39;en Party at the Library</h1>

<h2>Mel Walker</h2>

<h3>October 2023</h3>

<p>I picked my way through the debris-laden hole in the wall of the old school. I had left my car down the road, pulled into a clearing, and left my bicycle on the ground near the fence which surrounded the burnt-over section of the old mining town.</p>

<p>I was careful — who knew if the ceiling was still stable, or if anything would fall on me? My friends kept telling me to buy a hard hat, like the construction workers wear, but I kept putting it off. </p>

<p>Nothing in this building looked photogenic, so I carefully pushed open the doors into the dark hallway to the library. The debris was minimal here, without any signs of animals. The library had a hole in the roof over where the central study tables had been. Now there were bushes and two trees, a small cypress off to one side and, right smack dead center, a hauntingly beautiful red maple.</p>

<p>“Wow,” I said, taken aback. This expedition was going well. I put a wide-angle lens on my camera and proceeded to take photos of the maple with the old shelves of the library in the background. I’d heard about this place, and how it still had books on the shelves, and the stories were true. Photos of the maple with full bookshelves in the background was a unique setting, and I was getting the most of it. After a little while, I stopped trying to frame my photos, deciding to rely on cropping the images after-the-fact.</p>

<p>I heard a noise behind me, and turned to see what was there. Maybe the animals didn’t stay out of the library as much as it looked like. I didn’t see anything, just some books on the shelves. Noises always make me nervous, though, and while it’s probably never saved my life, reacting to them has likely spared me some injuries. Therefore, I walked over next to the trees and ran through my all the photos I’d taken on my camera.</p>

<p>Most of them were at least pretty good. A few had captured the sunlight on the leaves just right, and I knew at least one of them would make its way into a contest.</p>

<p>Something was wrong, though, but I wasn’t sure what. I looked around, but saw nothing; no movement at all. I looked again at the photos, moving back-and-forth through the album, until I saw it.</p>

<p>“There are five books on that shelf,” I murmured to myself, “but here there’s only four.” I looked at the shelf in real life. Sure enough, three books in a pile, horizontally, with a fourth book leaning against the pile.</p>

<p>“There was a book leaning on the other side,” I said to myself, looking at the photo I’d just taken a few minutes ago. Butterflies filled my stomach, but I had to walk over and see. Sure enough, there was a little pile of dust and dirt — <em>something</em> had been there to accumulate the dirt, but it wasn’t there now.</p>

<p>I spun around at another noise behind me. Where I had been standing to take my photos, there was a bookshelf, but the bookshelf was empty. It hadn’t been empty before I’d walked away — a book had been there. The title had faded and the book cover had fallen apart, but now the shelf was bare and book-less.</p>

<p>“Okay,” I said, “who’s there? I know I’m trespassing, so I’ll just leave and save you the trouble.”</p>

<p>I looked around, but saw and (now) heard nothing.</p>

<p>“I’m leaving,” I said, and again, “I’m leav—“</p>

<p>The shelf had a book on it again.</p>

<p>I held my breath for a long time, then slowly let it out. Nothing changed in the room; there wasn’t even any wind to rustle the leaves on the tree. The sun shone brightly through the hole in the ceiling, and the edges of the room were still cloaked in shadow. I swallowed hard, and started walking over to the shelf. I barely lifted my feet off the ground. I didn’t take my eyes off the book, for fear it would vanish again.</p>

<p>It was still there when I reached out for it. I tapped it, lightly, gently, but it existed, so I laid my hand on it.</p>

<p>Nothing happened.</p>

<p>I lifted it up. The title was unreadable, so I opened it up, and read the title page out loud.</p>

<p>“<em>Hickory Dickory Dock</em>,” I read, “by Agatha Christie.” I flipped through the pages. “And, surprisingly, in good condition. Not a bad read. Not one of my favorites, but pretty good. I wonder how many Christie books they have.”</p>

<p>“Many,” a voice said. I whirled around to look down the row of shelves. I saw a fog where it became darker. The fog came into focus, coalescing into what looked like a man wearing overalls.</p>

<p>My heart raced. I tried to find the words to speak, to find any words, but I couldn’t seem to make my brain work. This couldn’t be possible — and yet, where had he come from?</p>

<p>The man said, “I didn’t mean to frighten you.”</p>

<p>“I, I, I, I… do you live around here?” I asked.</p>

<p>He smiled. “I don’t live around anywhere,” he said.</p>

<p>That was not the answer I wanted. “So, you’re, um….”</p>

<p>He smiled again. “An Agatha Christie fan. I had an <em>Appointment with Death</em>, you might say.”</p>

<p>“I should run away,” I mumbled.</p>

<p>“You can stay, if it suits you,” he said. “You’re a photographer? Is that what you are?”</p>

<p>I stammered out an answer. “I run a blog. It’s called Werifesteria — that’s a word that means to wander through the wilderness in search of magic and mystery. I… take unusual photos of places most people can’t get to.”</p>

<p>“What’s a blog?” asked the specter.</p>

<p>“Yeah, I guess… you might not know,” I said. “Uh… it’s like a column in a magazine? You know magazines?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” he said. “There’s an entire section back over there.” He waved a translucent arm.</p>

<p>“It’s like a column without the magazine,” I said. “People read it to see my photos and read about how I took them. I sell some advertising.”</p>

<p>“A column without the magazine,” he said. “That’s a new one. We didn’t have that in my day.”</p>

<p>“Uh,” I said again, then decided it was the only chance I was likely to get, “when was your day? Did you die here in the school?”</p>

<p>“Not me, no,” he said, “I died in the mine. My pappy was a miner and my grandpappy, too, so I followed them in. My ma taught me my letters, and when I was old enough, I started digging. One day, we hit a gas pocket and I didn’t get out in time.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know a lot about ghosts or dead people or specters or whatever you call yourself,” I said, “but aren’t you supposed to haunt the place you died?”</p>

<p>“Ha!” He barked out a laugh, then coughed. “I remember being there. There were a lot of us there, but one day the other people, you know, your kind, they weren’t there anymore. Nothing happened for a long time, and then, one night, I was here. Then everyone was gone from here, too.” He looked around. “It’s been lonely.”</p>

<p>“Everything I ever heard about ghosts is wrong,” I said. “Were you trying to scare me? Is that why you moved the books around?”</p>

<p>“Nah, not that at all,” he said. “I was reading the one on that shelf, and I didn’t want you to take it with you. It’s the only one.”</p>

<p>“I get it,” I said, almost-but-not-quite lying. “Another Christie book?”</p>

<p>“<em>Murder in Mesopotamia</em>,” the ghost said.</p>

<p>I nodded. “I don’t think I’ve read that since… well, middle school, maybe. How does a school library end up with a complete set?”</p>

<p>“I don’t even know how this school got here,” he said. “I can’t remember the name of the town.”</p>

<p>“Harris Mine Town, originally,” I said, “founded just after the Harris mine company was started, a real old-time company town. That’s probably when you were here, or maybe when your grandfather was here. Eventually, it was renamed to Harriston when the post office went in. Then war started and they needed a lot of metal, so the town boomed. The school went in right at the end of the war. Twenty years later, the mine played out, the fire hit this part of town, and the Harris family corporation decided to just put up a fence and not put any more money into this company town. A few people live on the far edge of town, but I think they’re just too poor to move.”</p>

<p>“That’s why you said you were trespassing,” the ghost said.</p>

<p>“I am trespassing,” I said, “legally, at least. I do that a lot for my blog, but I try to find places where nobody cares.” I looked at the sunlit part of the room. “That’s really a beautiful tree,” I said.</p>

<p>“I don’t look at it much,” he said, “sun hurts my eyes. Or… do I have eyes?”</p>

<p>“You read, so you must,” I said. “It’s a pleasure to meet another fan of Agatha.”</p>

<p>“When I got here,” he said, “I tried to read, but couldn’t, so I found a simple book and tried it. I got good, then I found the detective mysteries shelves, and then I found Agatha Christie. All her books aren’t there, and some of them get chewed up. I keep the animals and bugs away now.”</p>

<p>“How?” I asked.</p>

<p>He shook his head. “Dunno. Just do.”</p>

<p>“I’m a big fan, too,” I said, rummaging through my pack. “I never go anywhere without a book.” I held my current one up for him to see.</p>

<p>I didn’t know ghosts could gasp. “It’s <em>Murder on the Orient Express</em>!” he said. “Everything that I read says it’s the best, but it’s not here! The, uh, catalog box says they have it, but it’s not here!”</p>

<p>I nodded. “Probably flew off after the fire, with someone’s help,” I said. I looked down at the book, and then over at my deceased acquaintance, and made a decision. I held out the book.</p>

<p>“It’s yours,” I said. I put it on the shelf next to <em>Hickory Dickory Dock</em>. “There you go.”</p>

<p>Suddenly, I felt an icy blast of air, and the ghost was standing next to me. “I can’t tell you….” he began.</p>

<p>“It’s the least I could do, since you let me take photos in your library,” I said.</p>

<p>He looked me in the eyes, and chilled me to the bone, making me wish I’d brought a winter coat. “It’s not my library.”</p>

<p>I took a step back. “If it’s not yours, then I don’t know who it belongs to,” I said. “Anyway, the book is yours.”</p>

<p>“Is it as good as they say?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to spoil it for you, but yes,” I said, “it is. Enjoy it.” I noticed the room had darkened a bit, and looked at my watch.</p>

<p>“I need to get going,” I said. </p>

<p>Another blast of cold air. “You can’t stay?” he asked. “I’m at my best at night.”</p>

<p>“I am not,” I said, “and I don’t want people to see a light on.”</p>

<p>He looked me in the eyes, again, and I shivered. “If you ever get back up here,” he said, “you could visit. Maybe photograph the tree again?”</p>

<p>“That would be nice,” I said. I nodded my head instead of risking a handshake, and turned to leave. I heard him pick up the murder mystery from the shelf, but didn’t look back. <em>Murder on the Orient Express</em> deserves to be enjoyed in peace.</p>

<p>On my way out, I found the mystery section and took a photo of the Agatha Christie shelf. If I ever did come back this way, it wouldn’t hurt to bring a gift.</p>
