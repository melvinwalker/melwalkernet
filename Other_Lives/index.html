<h1>Other Lives</h1>

<p>“Welcome, seeker, to the Center for the Pursuit of Happiness,” I said, as the next seeker approached my desk. “Please have a seat, and we will talk.”</p>

<p>She looked nervous. She approached my desk, hesitated, then sat down. She was dressed modestly, in a dress and shirt which looked damaged and shabby.</p>

<p>“May I have your name?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Marie,” she said, “Marie Buttersworth.”</p>

<p>“Nice to meet you, Marie,” I said. “I am Stephanie. How may I help you today, Marie?”</p>

<p>Marie said, “I want to kill myself. I want to die. I just want....” She trailed off, looking down at her feet.</p>

<p>“Then you’ve come to the right place,” I said. “Have you filled out the packet of forms?”</p>

<p>“Um…” she said.</p>

<p>They were always sending the weird cases to me. I sighed to myself, and put a smile on my face. </p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” I said, “I can help you with whatever you need.”</p>

<p>“Can you?” She was almost whispering, and I leaned forward to hear her better.</p>

<p>“I’m sensing unfinished paperwork is the least of our problems,” I said. “Am I right?”</p>

<p>“I…” she began, then her head sunk once again.</p>

<p>“Tell me, and I promise I can help,” I said. Following my training, I waited for her to start talking. After a minute or two, she did.</p>

<p>“I just turned 18,” she said. She looked up. Her eyes were wide . “I can prove it! I have my ID!” </p>

<p>She frantically searched through her pockets, and pulled out a state-issued ID, and held it up for me to see.</p>

<p>I couldn’t help but chuckle. “It’s quite okay, Marie, I believe you. So, you just turned 18. What else do I need to know?”</p>

<p>“Is… all this… I dunno, legal or something?” she asked.</p>

<p>I chuckled again, trying to project a friendly aura. “Of course,” I said. “Everything we do is completely legal under Federal and State law.”</p>

<p>“But what about… God?” she said.</p>

<p>I sigh. “Marie,” I said, “I cannot advise you on what God does or does not believe or teach, or even if such a being exists.”</p>

<p>Marie sunk even deeper into her chair, then looked up and started spouting words like a machine gun. “I need something new,” she said, “a new life. My life is bad, super bad, awful bad, and I can’t see how it will ever get better. It’s not going to get better! Everything will get worse and I want to start over now! Please let me!”</p>

<p>I took a breath, then spoke. “Marie,” I said, “you are 18 years old and, by law, you have the right to decide whether or to deliberately trigger a reincarnation. The law gives that right to you, and only to you. Not me, not the government, not your parents or siblings or teachers or neighbors. You are the only one who is allowed to decide, and the only one who can.”</p>

<p>She was listening, so I continued. “That being said, have you considered some kind of therapy?”</p>

<p>“Therapy?” she managed to say with a gulp.</p>

<p>“It’s not a requirement,” I quickly said. “Still, some people find it helps give some perspective.”</p>

<p>“I have perspective!” she said. </p>

<p>I nodded. “Fair enough,” I said. “Again, it’s entirely your decision.”</p>

<p>“Perspective,” she said. “I know what’s right for me! I know what God wants for me, and I know what I want to do.”</p>

<p>I knew I shouldn’t, but I did. “Are those three all the same thing?”</p>

<p>“YES!” she yelled. Her flew open wide again. She covered her mouth with hands, and recoiled. I waited patiently, trying to look as friendly and (especially) non-threatening.</p>

<p>Before either of us found something more to say, my desk phone buzzed. I saw it was from the front desk, so I picked up the receiver.</p>

<p>“Stephanie Banks,” I said.</p>

<p>“Stephanie, this is Mike at the front desk. I have a Mr. and Mrs. Buttersworth here, asking to speak to their daughter, Marie. Is she still at your desk?”</p>

<p>“You know these sessions are private,” I said. “Do not, I repeat, do not let them come back. You know the rules.”</p>

<p>“They claim their daughter is a minor,” he said.</p>

<p>“Please hold,” I said, and punched the hold button.</p>

<p>“Marie,” I said, “I need to see your ID.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” She was more frightened than I’d see her so far. </p>

<p>“I just need to examine it, officially this time,” I said. I held out my hand. “Please, Marie.”</p>

<p>She fished it out of her pocket, and handed it to me with a shaky hand. I took it from her, and held it up to the scanner.</p>

<p>The scanner beeped. Marie’s information appeared on my tablet.</p>

<p>“Marie Buttersworth, birthday was… yesterday, looks like. Photo looks like you. Let’s ask a couple questions… What high school did you attend?”</p>

<p>“Roosevelt High, here in town.”</p>

<p>“Do you know where your mother was born?”</p>

<p>“Um… Cleveland, I think.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.” I picked up the phone and continued the call.</p>

<p>“Mike,” I said, “She’s not a minor.”</p>

<p>“Hang on,” he said. I heard the phone be placed on his desk. He apparently wanted me to hear.</p>

<p>“If neither of you are here to engage in business with our organization, please leave,” I heard him say. Screaming immediately erupted. I heard him threaten them with security, and they screamed about lawsuits and how she was their daughter and they had rights.</p>

<p>Mike hadn’t wasted any time —&nbsp;I heard security show up. The screaming died down to loud complaints which I couldn’t quite hear, which completely died out when they had been escorted outside.</p>

<p>Mike picked the phone back up. “They have left the building. Security is watching them leave the parking lot. Please call the front desk if she chooses to leave on her own.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Mike,” I said, and hung up. I held out Marie’s ID. “Sorry about that.”</p>

<p>“It was my parents,” she said. “It was, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“They were escorted out by our security staff,” I said. “As I said, it’s your decision, and no one is allowed to make that decision but you.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to do it,” she said. She didn’t look afraid anymore — in fact, she was starting to look almost confident. “As long as I don’t have to come back to the same family.”</p>

<p>“The odds are overwhelmingly against it,” I said. </p>

<p>She looked me right in my eyes, and asked, “Will I remember?”</p>

<p>“Again, the vast majority of the reincarnated have no memories of any of their past lives,” I said. “You need not worry.”</p>

<p>“If they find out who I reincarnated as, what happens?”</p>

<p>“In the United States, there are laws against that kind of new-life tracking without permission,” I said, “so even if you gave that permission, you wouldn’t be able to give permission for 18 years. All in all, though, these aren’t something to worry about. You will be someone different.”</p>

<p>“How different?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Different life, of course,” I said, “also different part of the world, maybe a different language, different hair color, different ethnicity, possibly even a different sex. Different families, different friends, different parents. It’s either random, or scientists haven’t figured out a pattern yet.”</p>

<p>I stopped smiling, and looked at her seriously. “Do you want to be different?”</p>

<p>She said, “I don’t want to be me anymore.”</p>

<p>I indicated the reader on my desk. “Thumb print here,” I said. She pressed her thumb. The reader lit up and beeped.</p>

<p>I helped up a tablet with text on it. “Now, Marie, I’ll need you to say this sentence, and swear it is true. You will be recorded for legal purposes. Oh, and we need your full name, no initials.”</p>

<p>She nodded. “I, Marie Natalie Buttersworth, being of sound mind, acting under all applicable laws and regulations, confirm that I wish to trigger a reincarnation experience, with full understanding that it will cause the termination of my current life, or death.”</p>

<p>I tapped the button, saving her recording, ID, and thumbprint in the system.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Marie,” I said. “Final question: do you wish to carry out the procedure now, or do you have any final business to conclude?”</p>

<p>“Now,” she said. </p>

<p>I stood up. “Then follow me,” I said. She stood, and we walked to her reserved End-of-Life room. I opened the door. Only a chair broke the constant light of the room.</p>

<p>“This is it?” she said. </p>

<p>“Yes,” I said. “Go inside, sit down, and the room will take care of the rest. It’s quite painless and quick. We don’t make you wait.”</p>

<p>Marie started to cry. “This is the best day of my life,” she said. She turned suddenly and wrapped me in a hug. I returned it — such displays of emotion weren’t unusual, even if it being the “best day” was a new one for me.</p>

<p>She let go. “Thank you,” she said, and sat down in the chair.</p>

<p>“I’m glad I could help,” I said, and closed the door. The crackling sound happened three seconds after I had engaged the lock, followed by the whooshing sound of the room being vacuumed.</p>

<p>I stood there for a second, and I wondered. Would she have benefited from therapy of some sort? Would her parents even let that happen? Yes, she was 18, but that didn’t always matter in the real world.</p>

<p>I shook my head and blinked. “Not my business anymore,” I said to myself as I walked back to my desk. I had to sign the death certificate as soon as the system sent it to me, and take care of the bureaucratic details of the end of a human life. I busied myself in my work, and put her out of my mind. There would be another at my desk before too much longer. There was always someone ready to take a desperate leap in the hopes of being happy.</p>
