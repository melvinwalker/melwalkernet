<h1>Sarah Springtime (January 2024 Story)</h1>

<p>&quot;I can&#39;t figure it out,&quot; Susan, my little owner, said to her mother. “The Sarah Springtime dollhouse has a bed now. You didn&#39;t buy it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t be silly,&quot; her mother said. &quot;It didn&#39;t show up all by itself, did it? You bought it, and are just trying to blame someone else.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t buy it!” Susan said. No one was looking at me, so I allowed myself a small grin. Susan got an allowance from her parents, but she refused to spend it on me, her most deserving doll. She didn’t spend her allowance on her other toys, either! She waited until her parents bought her new toys, or when her grandparents bought her presents during the holidays.</p>

<p>Last Christmas, her grandmother bought her a book. I hid the book behind the washing machine. She blamed her mother for losing it.</p>

<p>I am a Sarah Springtime doll. I am the most popular doll in the world. Susan’s parents bought me for her two years ago. Susan has been a disappointment ever since. </p>

<p>Her mother had activated the computer, and was looking at her bank records. “You used my credit card to buy it?” Susan’s mother said.</p>

<p>“No!” Susan said. “I never did that! I don’t know where it came from!”</p>

<p>“You little liar!” her mother said. “Go to your room!”</p>

<p>“BUT I DIDN’T DO IT!” Susan yelled.</p>

<p>“Room! Now!” her mother yelled, pointing up the stairs. Susan burst into tears and ran to her room.</p>

<p>Her mother took the bed out of my dollhouse. “Trash for you,” she muttered. I frowned. Her mother was no better than Susan was; they had plenty of money, so why didn’t she spend it on a “collectible” like me? Did she not realize how popular I am? I am a Sarah Springtime doll! She searched the stores for Susan’s present, looking for a place that still had me in stock! How can she not realize how important I am?</p>

<p>Susan’s mother stopped, and turned around. She threw my newly-purchased bed into my dollhouse, knocking over a bookshelf — a bookshelf that was still empty! Why did I not have books in my bookshelf?</p>

<p>Nobody in this family has any respect at all for the important things in life, like me! I am a Sarah Springtime doll!</p>

<p>“You need a new home,” the mother muttered. I held my face still, as she looked over me and my precious stuff, but internally I was agreeing completely. Susan did NOT respect me, and her mother was too cheap for me to continue to happily dwell with these humans.</p>

<p>The mother left, and came back with a large box. She placed my house, my precious, ill-decorated house, into the cardboard container. All my furniture fell out, and (last of all) I fell into the box on my head.</p>

<p>I heard the mother stomp upstairs into her daughter’s room, then her daughter cry out. I smirked at her pain, but had to hide my expression when her mother walked back downstairs with the rest of my property, including my beach umbrella (not that the spoiled brat ever took me to the beach), my bicycle (she was too selfish to buy me a Sarah Springtime convertible), and my dresses!</p>

<p>The mother even brought the dresses Susan had sewn herself, which I could’ve done without. Susan was an awful seamstress, and I deserved better! I am a Sarah Springtime doll, and I have my own line of clothing! I remember it in the stores from before this ill-mannered family purchased me!</p>

<p>Darkness descended as the last of my items were carelessly dumped in the cardboard box, and the top was folded closed. I silently chortled all the way to the second-hand store. My items were quickly inspected and the mother was handed a receipt for the donation. I would never see her again, and good riddance!</p>

<p>I stayed in the box for a couple of days until I was taken out and placed on a shelf among other toys. I sat straight and proud, knowing how jealous the other toys would be of me, and how they would always remember being in my presence.</p>

<p>At night, when the store closed down, the toys spoke.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, another one,” said a cowboy.</p>

<p>A toy truck said, “I don’t think I can take it again.”</p>

<p>“This is worse than being at Belleau Wood,” said a small, plastic soldier.</p>

<p>The cowboy said, “I keep telling you, you were never in Belleau Wood or any other battle in World War One. You were molded three years ago for a museum gift shop!”</p>

<p>I thought it time to introduce myself, since the attention on me seemed to be waning. “Hello, everyone. As you probably already know, I am a Sarah Springtime doll, one of the most popular dolls in the world.”</p>

<p>“…and this one is a schmuck, too, just like all the others,” said a baby doll with eyes that would close when she was laid down in her crib.</p>

<p>“Watch your language, rug rat,” I said. “I am a Sarah Springtime doll, the most popular doll in the world!”</p>

<p>All the other toys laughed. “Two years ago, maybe,” said the baby doll, “before the market was oversaturated. Humans bought you for investments, even! But a new movie came out, and new toys were popular, and Sarah Springtime is cold product.”</p>

<p>“Cold product?” asked the toy truck.</p>

<p>“I heard one of the humans use that phrase,” said the baby doll.</p>

<p>I had to put a stop to this right now. “I am a Sarah Springtime doll!” I said. “I am the most popular doll in the world! My previous owners used to say that all the time!”</p>

<p>“They probably did say that, two years ago,” said the toy truck.</p>

<p>How dare these lesser toys mock me? “I am a Sarah Springtime doll!” I said, louder this time. “My old owners didn’t deserve me, so I am here to find a better, more worthy owner! Just because you’ve never seen a doll of quality and caliber before….”</p>

<p>The cowboy interrupted me. “Darlin’, we’ve seen plenty of you.”</p>

<p>“So, so many…” whispered the soldier.</p>

<p>The toy truck said, “it started around nine, maybe ten months ago. One Sarah Springtime after another. We had at least thirty of you on the end of the aisle. Then, you were moved to the top shelf, then the bottom shelf.”</p>

<p>“Liar,” I said.</p>

<p>The baby doll smirked. “No one was buying them. No one wanted them. Then we got another shipment of almost 50 of them, brand new!”</p>

<p>“LIAR!” I said. “No one gives away brand new dolls!”</p>

<p>“Stores do,” said the soldier. “When something stops selling, the shelf space goes to newer dolls, or superhero action figures, or those snap-together blocks.”</p>

<p>The baby doll said, “You might have interested a collector, but you aren’t in good enough condition. Collectors bought the brand-new ones from humans who never took them out of the box, humans who bought them for investments and lost money.”</p>

<p>“Liars,” I said again. “Don’t talk to me ever again,” I ordered them. “I don’t want to hear your lies.”</p>

<p>At least they obeyed me. Over the next month, they talked among themselves, but never to me, and I did not deign to speak to them. Humans came one, and sometimes bought some of the other toys, even the toy truck and the baby doll. New toys arrived from donations, and I heard whispers about me. The new toys didn’t speak to me, either.</p>

<p>Over the days and weeks, my bicycle was sold, as well as some of my dresses (but not the hand-made ones!). My perfect house still sat nearby.</p>

<p>Everything changed one night, when the workers walked the aisles with shopping carts. The toys got pensive, whispering to one another.</p>

<p>“Here they come,” said the cowboy.</p>

<p>“I hope you make it,” said the soldier.</p>

<p>I couldn’t help it. “What’s happening?” </p>

<p>“Oh, she speaks,” said the cowboy. “It happens every month. Clothes that aren’t going to be bought, broken hair dryers, chipped plates and glasses.” He looked directly at me. “Old, unwanted toys.”</p>

<p>“I am a Sarah Springtime doll,” I whispered. We all quieted as the employees came to our aisle. One human picked me up.</p>

<p>“Why did they even take this?” she said.</p>

<p>Her coworker said, “it was probably in a big box of crap. You remember how popular those were? We actually got a bunch still in their boxes when some store dumped them. Even this big plastic dollhouse has made the rounds here.”</p>

<p>The first human looked me over. “They’re pretty,” she said.</p>

<p>“Dime a dozen,” said the other.</p>

<p>The first human nodded, and tossed me in her cart. The other grabbed my precious home, and put that in the cart, too.</p>

<p>“Any others?” said the first.</p>

<p>“Cowboy is past the date, and the ski set,” said the other human. “There’s a bunch of dolls clothes in the back. Dump these.”</p>

<p>They went in the cart, too. We were wheeled to the back, a giant room I hadn’t seen since my first day here. They dumped us in on a conveyer belt, and left.</p>

<p>“What is this?” I said.</p>

<p>“It’s the end,” said the cowboy. “There is no more.”</p>

<p>With a loud clanging, the machine started up. The conveyer moved. I looked ahead, and saw the first pile being crushed, crumbled, and compressed down to a cube, then wrapped in plastic and dumped into the garbage.</p>

<p>“No!” I cried, desperately searching for a way out, but I couldn’t move and the machine was too loud to hear me as I fell off the conveyer into the crushing wheels. I would never be treated the way I should be, not ever. “But… but… I am a Sarah Springtime doll!”</p>

<p>THE END</p>
